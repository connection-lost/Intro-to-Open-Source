##2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
A license specifies what could users do to the software distributed. It grants permission to user what could do. Preventing the work getting stolen or used in unwilling purposes.

##3. Why they SHOULD'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
A project without explicit license could be potentially unsafe to use. The user could potentially violate how the original author's idea. Therefore, it will create unwillingness the author may have.

##4. Do you agree with this claim? write two to five sentences.
I agree. Since the world is open to creations, Gopher has to face more adaptions around him. It is very possible for any one to have a better project.

##5. Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).
Microsoft's .Net platform is created to encourage people to adapt. MIT license have ralatively loose limit, which make developer easier and safer and easier to use the existing .Net resource.

##6. Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
