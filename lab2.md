##2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
A license specifies what could users do to the software distributed. It grants permission to user what could do. Preventing the work getting stolen or used in unwilling purposes.

##3. Why they SHOULD'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
A project without explicit license could be potentially unsafe to use. Project with no license will default to have no permission to use or modify the code. Also author's actual thoughs about licensing will not able to taken into consideration. It is easy to violate the author's idea.

##4. Do you agree with this claim? write two to five sentences.
I agree. Since the world is open to creations, Gopher has to face more adaptions around him. It is very possible for any one to have a better project.

##5. Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).
Microsoft's .Net platform is created to encourage people to adapt. MIT license have ralatively loose limit, which make developer easier and safer and easier to use the existing .Net resource.

##6. Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
Example project: Shuttle Tracker for RPI
License chooser gives: MIT License

##7. Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences.
GPL is better for companies. It allows companies to charge for their compiled code, while still delivering the source code to the open community. The community has to obey the same or higher version of GPL while using the code, which discourages others to use their code in other ways more freely.
LGPL is better for developers. It shares similar properties as GPL does, but modified code does not have to tied with GPL.
Apache/BSD is better for common good. They basiclly means "do whatever you want". Also they have some focus on no warrenties so that people can just give out the code away and forget about any issues it may arise.

##8. Create a repository and choose a license

##9. Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose.
Shuttle Tracker for RPI, MIT License
Users could be any RPI students taking the shuttle. Depending on the extensibility of the project, the project could also be used on any school or organization with busses that are linked to the iTrak API. The reason choosing MIT license is the code does not worth any real revenue, it is better to just give them to the community and let them free to adapt.

Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects - create a table which project has which license.
