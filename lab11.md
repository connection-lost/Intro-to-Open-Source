###1.3    
I joined #ubuntu channel on irc.freenode.net.     
Upon joining, message of the day shows up. It has information about what this channel is, and what can user expect to get in this channel. #ubuntu channel is the unofficial support for Ubuntu operating system, and people are able to ask questions and get answers with other community members.    
There are also too many users in this channel, currently it has 1900+. This makes the channel getting spammed by user joining and leaving messages.

* Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication.    
Synchronous communication are like IRC, where there is an absolute workflow for all user communications. Asynchronous communications are like the titanic pad shown above, where user are able to write down things whenever they want, which allows multiple users collaborate on the same file at the same time.
* Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction.    
Individuals have the full control of the entire project, but since there is not enough man power, bigger projects are harder to achieve. Groups however has more man power, but it has more issues if their collaboration is bad.
* Discuss several issues of social concern raised by collaborative software.    
It is unknown that how a software can go wrong. Collaborative software is controled by more people, therefore increased the risk in the entire userbase.
* Discuss the HCI issues in software that embodies human intention.     
The issue is that computers are not doing what human want them to do, they can only do what human asked them to do instead. It could be an issue sometimes when human are giving the wrong command to computers therefore lead to wrong outcome.
